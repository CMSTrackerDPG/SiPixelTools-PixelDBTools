Instructions on how to create a SiPixelQuality DB:
The updated cc and h files have not been pull to MasterCMSSW, they are just kept in this github account:
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder.cc
and
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder.h
so the first step is to overwrite these files in the CMSSW CondTools/SiPixel/test/
then modify
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/0SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder_cfg_Run305064.py
lines 30 (sqlite filename, make sure that this didnt exists in the folder where you're working), line 33 (tagname), line 136 (input file list) in 0SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder_cfg_Run305064.py
and then you have to have filelist similar to SiPixelQuality_phase1_Run3Beginning_forDigitizer_fixed.txt which is a list according to the DQM naming convention where there is a whitespace between the ROC and its number.
