Instructions on how to create a SiPixelQuality DB:
The updated cc and h files have not been pull to MasterCMSSW, they are just kept in this github account:
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder.cc
and
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder.h
so the first step is to overwrite these files in the CMSSW CondTools/SiPixel/test/
then modify
https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/master/PixelDBTools/test/0SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilder_cfg_Run305064.py
ines 30 (sqlite filename, make sure that this didnt exists in the folder where you're working), line 33 (tagname), line 45 (input file list) in yourFileName.py
and then you have to have filelist similar to SiPixelQuality_phase1_Run3Beginning_forDigitizer_fixed.txt which I believe is actually the DQM naming convention where there is a whitespace between the ROC and it's number. This will then create an sqlite file which contains the bad components you put in the txt file.
